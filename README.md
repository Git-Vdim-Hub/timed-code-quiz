# timed-code-quiz

## Description

At some point in our journies to become full-stack web developers, most-likely we will be asked to complete a coding assessment: perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

- To help re-inforce foundational coding knowledge I have built a timed code quiz web application.
- Overall this project helps individuals get familiar with full-stack coding terminology
- During this project I got very involved with the DOM, including the deployment of HTML elements with JS. Additionally I worked with event listeners and timing. Finally, local browser storage was used to store and retrieve information. All was done using vanilla javascript with no CDNs.

## Installation

## Tests

Completed Basic Functionality Testing including making sure all buttons work, all questions can be answered and all data can be stored and removed from local storage. Additionally time starts when quiz starts and time stops when the quiz is completed or the timer reaches zero. Finally, score is based on number of questions answered correctly (+5 points for each question) and remaining time (+remaining time at the end of the quiz).
